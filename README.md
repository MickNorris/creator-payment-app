## Creator Payment App (name pending)
 
This is a project for [EthGlobal Market Make Hackathon](https://marketmake.ethglobal.co/).

The basic idea is to take advantage of [AAVE's Lending Protocol](https://app.aave.com/) to enable content creators (or anyone with a large following) to get paid for the work they do through accrued interest. Fans will be able to support their creators by staking money in return for interest which will be paid to the creator. Because the initial funds are staked in a smart contract fans will be able to regain their stake at any point (minus transaction fees). This opens up a new world of possibilities for getting paid as a content creator, online personality, freelancer, etc. where fans and followers can support your work financially without having to actually spend their money. As of 1/21/21 AAVE offers stablecoin pools with up to 17% APY. This number can vary from day to day and I've seen it go as high as 22% on certain stablecoins. The amount of interest accrued is determined by the amount of money staked in the pool, so over time the accrued interest has the ability to compound fairly quickly.
